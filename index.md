[About the project](./about.html).

### Our Mission
With Waste2Drug, we aim to turn agricultural waste into life-saving opportunities. By transforming natural compounds from agri-waste into powerful anticancer drugs, we aspire to drive innovation at the intersection of sustainability and health. Supported by the [MSCA programme](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships), our mission is to build a circular bioeconomy where waste fuels discovery — creating value for people and the planet.
