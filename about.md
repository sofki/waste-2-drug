Agricultural waste contains terpenes, organic molecules suitable as chemical feedstocks for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Reducing, reusing, and recycling contribute to a circular economy. Supported by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) programme, the Waste2Drug project aims to convert agricultural waste (agri-waste) into valuable pharmaceutical products. Specifically, it focuses on transforming terpene-derived p-cymene into a potent anticancer drug. The project aims to identify p-cymene’s biological target and enhance its anticancer properties, alongside developing a more efficient procedure for extracting p-cymene from terpene-rich biomass. This initiative aligns with the EU bio-economy strategy by creating new anticancer drugs and using agricultural waste to produce valuable pharmaceutical molecules.
